# Employee generator
Python script used to generate test data for a Django REST API. 

## How it works
The script:
1. Generates specified number of random employees based on data found on the internet.
2. Randomizes worktime and creates a company worklog for given amount of days.

The hourly rate for a given position is a range and can be adjusted in the code.
